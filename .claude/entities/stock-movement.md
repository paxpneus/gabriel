# Stock / StockMovement entity

`src/modules/inventory/stock/`

- `stock_movements` columns: `movement_type`, `direction`, `status`,
  `movement_quantity`, `balance_quantity`, `resulting_average_cost`,
  `unit_business_id`, `product_id`, `invoice_number`, `movement_date`.
  Anchor/correlation columns reference `invoice_number`, not a row id,
  because rows get hard-deleted and recreated.
  Has trigger `trigger_prevent_delete_manual_adjustment_with_cost`
  (BEFORE DELETE) that can block deleting a manual cost-adjustment
  movement.
- **`stock.controller.ts` has no auth at all (CRITICAL). `stock-movements.controller.ts`
  is unscoped by tenant (HIGH). Neither is fixed — see
  `.claude/modules/auth.md`.**
